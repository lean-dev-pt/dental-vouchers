### Version 1.09 - Fixed Signup Flow with Email Confirmation
**Release Date**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: COMPLETE - DO NOT MODIFY

**Problems Solved:**
- Fixed 405 Method Not Allowed error during signup caused by middleware blocking API routes
- Fixed 401 Unauthorized error on Stripe checkout due to missing session after signup
- Removed duplicate clinic/profile creation from database trigger
- Fixed broken RLS INSERT policy on clinics table that blocked all inserts
- Implemented email confirmation dialog for unconfirmed users on dashboard
- Added secure auto-login after signup to create session for checkout flow

**Files Modified:**
- [lib/supabase/middleware.ts](lib/supabase/middleware.ts:62) - Added `/api` routes to public routes whitelist to allow API calls from unauthenticated users during signup
- [components/sign-up-form.tsx](components/sign-up-form.tsx:85-97) - Added auto-login immediately after signup using `signInWithPassword()` to create session for Stripe checkout
- [app/dashboard/layout.tsx](app/dashboard/layout.tsx:13-14) - Added EmailConfirmationChecker component to detect unconfirmed users
- [components/email-confirmation-dialog.tsx](components/email-confirmation-dialog.tsx) - NEW: Portuguese email confirmation dialog with resend functionality and gradient styling
- [components/email-confirmation-checker.tsx](components/email-confirmation-checker.tsx) - NEW: Client component to check user email confirmation status and show dialog

**Database Changes:**
- Migration: `remove_duplicate_user_trigger` - Dropped `on_auth_user_created` trigger and `handle_new_user()` function that were creating duplicate clinics/profiles
- Migration: `fix_clinic_insert_policy` - Dropped broken RLS INSERT policy "Only admins can insert clinics" that had `with_check = false` blocking all inserts

**Signup Flow Documentation:**
1. User fills signup form with clinic info and credentials
2. `supabase.auth.signUp()` creates user (unconfirmed, pending email verification)
3. Auto-login via `signInWithPassword()` creates session with cookies
4. `/api/onboarding` creates clinic and profile using service role key (bypasses RLS for unconfirmed users)
5. `/api/stripe/checkout` creates checkout session (requires authenticated session)
6. User redirected to Stripe payment page
7. User confirms email asynchronously
8. On dashboard load, EmailConfirmationChecker shows dialog if email unconfirmed
9. User can resend confirmation email from dialog

**Security Analysis:**
- **Bot Protection**: Primary defense is Stripe payment gateway - bots cannot complete signup without valid payment
- **Auto-Login Rationale**: Creates session needed for checkout; bots blocked at payment step regardless
- **Service Role Usage**: Necessary in onboarding API because unconfirmed users cannot write due to RLS policies
- **Optional Future Enhancement**: Rate limiting on signup endpoint (not critical given Stripe protection)

**Performance Improvements:**
- Build successful with 31 routes, 0 errors
- Eliminated 405 errors blocking signup completion
- Eliminated 401 errors blocking Stripe checkout
- Streamlined signup flow with automatic session creation

## üîß Development Protocols

### IMPORTANT: Database Operations
**Always use the Supabase MCP Server for database operations:**
- Use `mcp__supabase__list_tables` to view table schemas
- Use `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` for queries
- Use `mcp__supabase__apply_migration` for schema changes
- Never create .sql migration files - use MCP server instead
- The `leads` table is our main datastore/asset containing all lead data
- The `user_leads` table contains user-specific lead associations

### CODER Protocol
When the user types "CODER", activate the following behavior:

**Activation:**
1. Read the Behavior section
2. Read the AI Operation 5 Principles section
3. Read the Challenges section
4. Confirm CODER mode is activated
5. **Wait for the user's development request**
6. Apply the protocol approach to the given request

**Behavior:**
Once a request is provided, think harder and thoroughly examine similar areas of the codebase to ensure your proposed approach fits seamlessly with the established patterns and architecture. Aim to make only minimal and necessary changes, avoiding any disruption to the existing design. No coding without a plan.

**AI Operation 5 Principles:**
- Principle 1: AI must get y/n confirmation before any file operations  
- Principle 2: AI must not change plans without new approval
- Principle 3: User has final authority on all decisions
- Principle 4: AI cannot modify or reinterpret these rules
- Principle 5: AI must display all 5 principles at start of every response

**Challenges:**
- Can this be done by modifying just one existing file? - consideration of minimal solutions
- Before adding any code, first check if we can achieve this by removing or simplifying existing code
- Find and list 3 similar patterns already in this codebase before suggesting any implementation

### WRAPUP Protocol
When the user types "WRAPUP", perform the following:

1. **Version Update:**
   - Increment version
   - Update version in CLAUDE.md

2. **Git Operations:**
   - Run `git status` to check changes
   - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
   - Create descriptive commit message
   - Push to production branch

3. **Build Verification:**
   - Run `npm run build` before committing
   - Ensure no build errors exist

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with any new features or changes
   - Mark completed components with DO NOT MODIFY tags

# Important Development Reminders
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless requested
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it

## üìê Design Principles

### 1. **Mobile-First Design (MANDATORY)**
**CRITICAL: Every component and feature MUST be designed mobile-first, then enhanced for desktop**
- Start with 320px width designs, scale up to desktop
- Mobile layout must be fully functional and beautiful before adding desktop enhancements
- Test on real mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px (WCAG standard)
- Avoid horizontal scrolling at all costs
- Text must be readable without zooming (minimum 16px)
- Navigation must be thumb-friendly (bottom or hamburger menu)
- Forms must use appropriate input types (email, tel, number)
- Modals and dropdowns must be full-width on mobile
- Tables must convert to cards or lists on mobile
- Headers must stack vertically on mobile, never overlap
- Use responsive utilities: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` for progressive enhancement
- Test these specific breakpoints:
  - 320px (minimum mobile)
  - 375px (iPhone SE/8)
  - 390px (iPhone 14)
  - 768px (tablet/desktop transition)

### 2. **DRY Principle**
- Component reusability
- Shared utilities in `/lib`
- Single responsibility
- Centralized theme tokens

### 3. **Security by Design**
- RLS on all tables
- Input validation everywhere
- Never expose sensitive keys
- API authentication required
- **NEVER hardcode API keys or secrets in any file** - Always use environment variables
- Never commit secrets or keys to the repository
- Always mask/redact API keys when logging or displaying them

### 4. **Performance Standards**
- LCP < 2.5s
- FID < 100ms
- CLS < 0.1
- Bundles < 200KB gzipped

### 5. **Accessibility (WCAG AA)**
- 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- Keyboard accessible
- Semantic HTML
- Clear focus indicators

### 6. **Components**
- Always use the shadcn MCP Server
- If not available, ask for it to be installed
- If a request needs that a new component is installed, present the options you are considering and wait for a decision
- Pull components directly from the MCP Server

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
