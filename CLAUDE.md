## üîß Development Protocols

### IMPORTANT: Database Operations
**Always use the Supabase MCP Server for database operations:**
- Use `mcp__supabase__list_tables` to view table schemas
- Use `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` for queries
- Use `mcp__supabase__apply_migration` for schema changes
- Never create .sql migration files - use MCP server instead
- The `leads` table is our main datastore/asset containing all lead data
- The `user_leads` table contains user-specific lead associations

### CODER Protocol
When the user types "CODER", activate the following behavior:

**Activation:**
1. Read the Behavior section
2. Read the AI Operation 5 Principles section
3. Read the Challenges section
4. Confirm CODER mode is activated
5. **Wait for the user's development request**
6. Apply the protocol approach to the given request

**Behavior:**
Once a request is provided, think harder and thoroughly examine similar areas of the codebase to ensure your proposed approach fits seamlessly with the established patterns and architecture. Aim to make only minimal and necessary changes, avoiding any disruption to the existing design. No coding without a plan.

**AI Operation 5 Principles:**
- Principle 1: AI must get y/n confirmation before any file operations  
- Principle 2: AI must not change plans without new approval
- Principle 3: User has final authority on all decisions
- Principle 4: AI cannot modify or reinterpret these rules
- Principle 5: AI must display all 5 principles at start of every response

**Challenges:**
- Can this be done by modifying just one existing file? - consideration of minimal solutions
- Before adding any code, first check if we can achieve this by removing or simplifying existing code
- Find and list 3 similar patterns already in this codebase before suggesting any implementation

### WRAPUP Protocol
When the user types "WRAPUP", perform the following:

1. **Version Update:**
   - Increment version
   - Update version in CLAUDE.md

2. **Git Operations:**
   - Run `git status` to check changes
   - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
   - Create descriptive commit message
   - Push to production branch

3. **Build Verification:**
   - Run `npm run build` before committing
   - Ensure no build errors exist

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with any new features or changes
   - Mark completed components with DO NOT MODIFY tags

# Important Development Reminders
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless requested
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it

## üìê Design Principles

### 1. **Mobile-First Design (MANDATORY)**
**CRITICAL: Every component and feature MUST be designed mobile-first, then enhanced for desktop**
- Start with 320px width designs, scale up to desktop
- Mobile layout must be fully functional and beautiful before adding desktop enhancements
- Test on real mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px (WCAG standard)
- Avoid horizontal scrolling at all costs
- Text must be readable without zooming (minimum 16px)
- Navigation must be thumb-friendly (bottom or hamburger menu)
- Forms must use appropriate input types (email, tel, number)
- Modals and dropdowns must be full-width on mobile
- Tables must convert to cards or lists on mobile
- Headers must stack vertically on mobile, never overlap
- Use responsive utilities: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` for progressive enhancement
- Test these specific breakpoints:
  - 320px (minimum mobile)
  - 375px (iPhone SE/8)
  - 390px (iPhone 14)
  - 768px (tablet/desktop transition)

### 2. **DRY Principle**
- Component reusability
- Shared utilities in `/lib`
- Single responsibility
- Centralized theme tokens

### 3. **Security by Design**
- RLS on all tables
- Input validation everywhere
- Never expose sensitive keys
- API authentication required
- **NEVER hardcode API keys or secrets in any file** - Always use environment variables
- Never commit secrets or keys to the repository
- Always mask/redact API keys when logging or displaying them

### 4. **Performance Standards**
- LCP < 2.5s
- FID < 100ms
- CLS < 0.1
- Bundles < 200KB gzipped

### 5. **Accessibility (WCAG AA)**
- 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- Keyboard accessible
- Semantic HTML
- Clear focus indicators

### 6. **Components**
- Always use the shadcn MCP Server
- If not available, ask for it to be installed
- If a request needs that a new component is installed, present the options you are considering and wait for a decision
- Pull components directly from the MCP Server
