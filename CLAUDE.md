### Version 1.14 - Fixed Test Login Page & Database Cleanup
**Release Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: COMPLETE - DO NOT MODIFY

**Problems Solved:**
- Fixed `/testlogin` page compilation error (deprecated @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs package)
- Discovered root cause of jorge@jorgedaniel.pt signup failure (existing identity with changed email)
- Performed comprehensive database cleanup to remove test accounts
- Enhanced test page with extensive debugging capabilities

**Root Cause of Email Mismatch:**
- User account created Sept 25 with `jorge@jorgedaniel.pt`
- Email was later changed to `lean.consultores.2011@gmail.com`
- Supabase keeps immutable record in `auth.identities.identity_data`
- Signup attempts with `jorge@jorgedaniel.pt` returned existing user with current email
- This caused apparent "email mismatch" where requested email ‚â† returned email

**Files Modified:**
- [app/testlogin/page.tsx](app/testlogin/page.tsx:4,48) - Replaced deprecated `createClientComponentClient()` with `createClient()` from lib/supabase/client
- [app/testlogin/page.tsx](app/testlogin/page.tsx:24-83) - Added enhanced logging: raw input tracking, session detection, payload verification, email comparison
- [app/testlogin/page.tsx](app/testlogin/page.tsx:93-114) - Added full JSON response dump and detailed user analysis
- [app/testlogin/page.tsx](app/testlogin/page.tsx:92-95,163,179) - Fixed ESLint errors (any type, escaped quotes)
- [lib/supabase/middleware.ts](lib/supabase/middleware.ts:69) - Already had `/testlogin` in public routes

**Database Cleanup Executed:**
- Deleted 4 test users: lean.consultores.2011@gmail.com, hello@leancrm.pt, jorge.daniel.2006@gmail.com, jorgedaniel.pwp@gmail.com
- Deleted 1 clinic: "Cl√≠nica Dental Principal" (6 doctors, 3 patients, 7 vouchers)
- Removed jorge@jorgedaniel.pt identity from auth.identities
- Kept only production users: marketing@lean-consultores.com, web@lean-consultores.com
- Kept only production clinic: "Cl√≠nica Melhores Sorrisos" (clean slate, 0 records)

**Features Added:**
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Test page now logs raw input, trimmed values, session state, exact payload, full response JSON
- **Email Comparison**: Automated detection of email mismatches with ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings
- **Session Detection**: Checks for existing sessions before signup attempts
- **Working Test Page**: `/testlogin` now compiles and deploys successfully

**Technical Details:**

- Test page now uses same Supabase client as production code
- Enhanced logging captures 10+ data points per signup attempt
- Database cleanup used cascading deletes: history ‚Üí records ‚Üí profiles ‚Üí clinic ‚Üí identities ‚Üí users

**Performance Improvements:**

### Version 1.13 - Investigated Custom Domain Email Signup Failure
**Release Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - NO CODE CHANGES

**Problem Investigated:**
- User `jorge@jorgedaniel.pt` could not sign up despite passing client-side validation
- Form redirected to `/auth/check-email` but no user was created in database
- No error messages shown to user (silent failure)
- No entries in Supabase auth logs

**Root Cause Identified:**
- **Supabase Email Deliverability Validation**: Supabase performs server-side email deliverability checks BEFORE creating users
- `jorgedaniel.pt` domain only has **CleanMX MX records** (hosting provider's catch-all email)
- Supabase's validation service does NOT recognize CleanMX as a legitimate email provider
- Supabase returns `{data: {user: null}, error: null}` to prevent email enumeration attacks
- Client code sees "no error" and redirects to check-email, causing silent failure

**Comparison Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ `hello@leancrm.pt` - Works (has Microsoft 365 MX priority 0)
- ‚úÖ `jorge.daniel.2006@gmail.com` - Works (Gmail)
- ‚úÖ `jorgedaniel.pwp@gmail.com` - Works (Gmail)
- ‚ùå `jorge@jorgedaniel.pt` - Fails (CleanMX only, no recognized email provider)

**DNS Analysis:**
```
jorgedaniel.pt:
  MX 10  mx1.cleanmx.pt  ‚ùå Not recognized by Supabase
  MX 20  mx2.cleanmx.pt  ‚ùå Not recognized by Supabase

leancrm.pt (works):
  MX 0   leancrm-pt.mail.protection.outlook.com  ‚úÖ Microsoft 365
  MX 10  mx1.cleanmx.pt  (fallback)
  MX 20  mx2.cleanmx.pt  (fallback)
```

**Recommended Solutions:**

**Option 1: Add Mailgun to Root Domain (RECOMMENDED)**
```dns
jorgedaniel.pt   MX   5    mxa.mailgun.org
jorgedaniel.pt   MX   5    mxb.mailgun.org
jorgedaniel.pt   MX   20   mx1.cleanmx.pt  (fallback)
jorgedaniel.pt   MX   30   mx2.cleanmx.pt  (fallback)
jorgedaniel.pt   TXT  "v=spf1 include:mailgun.org +a +mx +ip4:130.185.87.209 +include:_spf.cleanmx.pt ~all"
```

**Option 2: Configure Supabase Custom SMTP**
- Use Mailgun/SendGrid as Supabase's SMTP provider
- Bypasses email validation entirely
- Configure in: Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí SMTP Settings

**Option 3: Add Error Handling (Code Fix)**
Modify [components/sign-up-form.tsx:89-91](components/sign-up-form.tsx:89-91):
```typescript
if (!authData.user) {
  throw new Error(
    "Este dom√≠nio de email n√£o √© aceite pelo nosso sistema de verifica√ß√£o. " +
    "Por favor use um email de Gmail, Outlook, Microsoft, ou outro fornecedor reconhecido."
  );
}
```

**Option 4: Use Alternative Email**
- Use `jorge@leancrm.pt` (already has Microsoft 365)
- Or any Gmail/Outlook address

**Files Investigated:**
- [components/sign-up-form.tsx](components/sign-up-form.tsx:69-98) - Signup flow analysis
- [lib/supabase/client.ts](lib/supabase/client.ts) - Client configuration review
- Supabase auth logs (no entries for jorge@jorgedaniel.pt)
- Database auth.users table (no user created)

**Technical Details:**
- Supabase uses email validation services that check MX records and email provider reputation
- Domains without recognized email providers (Google, Microsoft, Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.) are flagged as "undeliverable"
- CleanMX is a hosting provider's default MX service, not a dedicated email service
- Supabase returns success (to prevent email enumeration) but doesn't create the user
- This is a server-side issue, not related to HTML5 validation fixed in v1.12

**Status:**
- Investigation complete
- Root cause identified and documented
- No code changes made (awaiting infrastructure decision)
- User can use alternative email addresses until DNS is configured

### Version 1.12 - Fixed Email Validation and Authenticated User Redirect
**Release Date**: October 13, 2025
**Status**: COMPLETE - DO NOT MODIFY

**Problems Solved:**
- Fixed signup failure with custom domain emails (e.g., `jorge@jorgedaniel.pt`) - emails never reached Supabase
- Browser HTML5 email validation was blocking valid custom domains before form submission
- Authenticated users could access `/auth/sign-up` and `/auth/login`, causing session conflicts
- User confusion when trying to signup while already logged in (Supabase used existing session email)

**Files Modified:**
- [components/sign-up-form.tsx](components/sign-up-form.tsx:175-184,42-48) - Changed input type from "email" to "text" with inputMode="email", added custom JavaScript email validation
- [components/login-form.tsx](components/login-form.tsx:92-101,36-42) - Same email validation fix for consistency
- [app/admin/login/page.tsx](app/admin/login/page.tsx:84-93,31-37) - Applied email validation fix to admin login
- [app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx](app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx:6-13) - Added server-side authentication check, redirects logged-in users to dashboard
- [app/auth/login/page.tsx](app/auth/login/page.tsx:5-12) - Added server-side authentication check, redirects logged-in users to dashboard
- [lib/supabase/middleware.ts](lib/supabase/middleware.ts:50-58) - Added middleware logic to redirect authenticated users away from auth pages

**Root Cause:**
- HTML5 `type="email"` validation performs browser-specific checks that can reject valid emails
- Some browsers reject certain domains (like `.pt` custom domains) even with valid MX records
- Signup attempts were blocked client-side, never reaching the Supabase backend
- Auth logs showed ZERO signup attempts for rejected emails (vs. explicit errors for truly invalid emails)

**Features Added:**
- **Custom Email Validation**: Replaced browser HTML5 validation with permissive JavaScript regex `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
- **Mobile Keyboard Support**: Used `inputMode="email"` to maintain email keyboard on mobile devices
- **Authenticated User Redirect**: Server-side and middleware protection prevents logged-in users from accessing auth pages
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Portuguese error messages for invalid email formats

**Technical Details:**
- Changed `<input type="email">` to `<input type="text" inputMode="email">` across all auth forms
- JavaScript validation runs before form submission to Supabase
- Server components check authentication status using `supabase.auth.getClaims()`
- Middleware intercepts `/auth/sign-up` and `/auth/login` for authenticated users, redirects to `/dashboard`
- Validation is consistent across: sign-up form, login form, and admin login

**Performance Improvements:**
- Build successful with 34 routes, 0 errors, 2 pre-existing ESLint warnings (unrelated)
- All email domains now accepted (including `.pt`, custom domains, and all TLDs)
- No more silent signup failures
- Clear UX: logged-in users automatically routed to dashboard

**Testing Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ `jorge.daniel.2006@gmail.com` - User created successfully (Gmail)
- ‚úÖ `jorgedaniel.pwp@gmail.com` - User created successfully (Gmail)
- ‚ùå `jorge@jorgedaniel.pt` - Previously failed silently (NO log entry), now expected to work
- Auth logs confirmed zero signup attempts before fix (browser blocked submission)

**Git Commits:**
- 0e634b8: fix: Replace HTML5 email validation with custom JavaScript validation

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and non-blocking history logging
- **Cleaner Account Page**: Removed placeholder UI sections (Notifications, Usage Statistics)
- **Streamlined Email Confirmation**: Removed confusing "back to login" option

**Technical Details:**
- Stripe API v2025-07-30 deprecated subscription-level `current_period_start` and `current_period_end`
- New location: `subscription.items.data[0].current_period_start` and `subscription.items.data[0].current_period_end`
- Reference: https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/basil/2025-03-31/deprecate-subscription-current-period-start-and-end
- Webhook now returns `{ received: true }` successfully to Stripe
- RLS policies allow both service_role (webhooks) and authenticated users to manage subscriptions

7. User confirms email asynchronously
8. On dashboard load, EmailConfirmationChecker shows dialog if email unconfirmed
9. User can resend confirmation email from dialog

**Security Analysis:**
- **Bot Protection**: Primary defense is Stripe payment gateway - bots cannot complete signup without valid payment
- **Auto-Login Rationale**: Creates session needed for checkout; bots blocked at payment step regardless
- **Service Role Usage**: Necessary in onboarding API because unconfirmed users cannot write due to RLS policies
- **Optional Future Enhancement**: Rate limiting on signup endpoint (not critical given Stripe protection)

**Performance Improvements:**
- Build successful with 31 routes, 0 errors
- Eliminated 405 errors blocking signup completion
- Eliminated 401 errors blocking Stripe checkout
- Streamlined signup flow with automatic session creation

## üîß Development Protocols

### IMPORTANT: Database Operations
**Always use the Supabase MCP Server for database operations:**
- Use `mcp__supabase__list_tables` to view table schemas
- Use `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` for queries
- Use `mcp__supabase__apply_migration` for schema changes
- Never create .sql migration files - use MCP server instead
- The `leads` table is our main datastore/asset containing all lead data
- The `user_leads` table contains user-specific lead associations

### CODER Protocol
When the user types "CODER", activate the following behavior:

**Activation:**
1. Read the Behavior section
2. Read the AI Operation 5 Principles section
3. Read the Challenges section
4. Confirm CODER mode is activated
5. **Wait for the user's development request**
6. Apply the protocol approach to the given request

**Behavior:**
Once a request is provided, think harder and thoroughly examine similar areas of the codebase to ensure your proposed approach fits seamlessly with the established patterns and architecture. Aim to make only minimal and necessary changes, avoiding any disruption to the existing design. No coding without a plan.

**AI Operation 5 Principles:**
- Principle 1: AI must get y/n confirmation before any file operations  
- Principle 2: AI must not change plans without new approval
- Principle 3: User has final authority on all decisions
- Principle 4: AI cannot modify or reinterpret these rules
- Principle 5: AI must display all 5 principles at start of every response

**Challenges:**
- Can this be done by modifying just one existing file? - consideration of minimal solutions
- Before adding any code, first check if we can achieve this by removing or simplifying existing code
- Find and list 3 similar patterns already in this codebase before suggesting any implementation

### WRAPUP Protocol
When the user types "WRAPUP", perform the following:

1. **Version Update:**
   - Increment version
   - Update version in CLAUDE.md

2. **Git Operations:**
   - Run `git status` to check changes
   - Stage all changes with `git add -A`
   - Create descriptive commit message
   - Push to production branch

3. **Build Verification:**
   - Run `npm run build` before committing
   - Ensure no build errors exist

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with any new features or changes
   - Mark completed components with DO NOT MODIFY tags

# Important Development Reminders
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless requested
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it

## üìê Design Principles

### 1. **Mobile-First Design (MANDATORY)**
**CRITICAL: Every component and feature MUST be designed mobile-first, then enhanced for desktop**
- Start with 320px width designs, scale up to desktop
- Mobile layout must be fully functional and beautiful before adding desktop enhancements
- Test on real mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px (WCAG standard)
- Avoid horizontal scrolling at all costs
- Text must be readable without zooming (minimum 16px)
- Navigation must be thumb-friendly (bottom or hamburger menu)
- Forms must use appropriate input types (email, tel, number)
- Modals and dropdowns must be full-width on mobile
- Tables must convert to cards or lists on mobile
- Headers must stack vertically on mobile, never overlap
- Use responsive utilities: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` for progressive enhancement
- Test these specific breakpoints:
  - 320px (minimum mobile)
  - 375px (iPhone SE/8)
  - 390px (iPhone 14)
  - 768px (tablet/desktop transition)

### 2. **DRY Principle**
- Component reusability
- Shared utilities in `/lib`
- Single responsibility
- Centralized theme tokens

### 3. **Security by Design**
- RLS on all tables
- Input validation everywhere
- Never expose sensitive keys
- API authentication required
- **NEVER hardcode API keys or secrets in any file** - Always use environment variables
- Never commit secrets or keys to the repository
- Always mask/redact API keys when logging or displaying them

### 4. **Performance Standards**
- LCP < 2.5s
- FID < 100ms
- CLS < 0.1
- Bundles < 200KB gzipped

### 5. **Accessibility (WCAG AA)**
- 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- Keyboard accessible
- Semantic HTML
- Clear focus indicators

### 6. **Components**
- Always use the shadcn MCP Server
- If not available, ask for it to be installed
- If a request needs that a new component is installed, present the options you are considering and wait for a decision
- Pull components directly from the MCP Server
